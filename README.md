###1.1 Performance Exercises (time oriented) ###
Lets do a competition!   
Please join in groups of 3/4.   
I am going to ask you to solve a problem by writing an algorithm.  
Remember that some of these algorithms can be evaluated in coding interviews.  

When you finish the problem sent it to up201607828@g.uporto.pt  
The group that has the fastest algorithm wins!  

####1.1.1 Count Primes Number ####
**Description:** Count the number of prime numbers **less** than a non-negative number, n.  
**Examples:**  
Input = 5 ; Output = 2;    
Input = 6; Output = 3;  

**How to:** Implement the interface `IPrimeCounter`.

####1.1.2 Most Frequent Elements in an Array ####
**Description:** Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.  
**Examples:**  
Input = [2, 3, 10, 10, 5, 5, 6, 6, 1, 10]; Output = [10, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3];    
Input = [2, 3, 10, 21, 10, 10, 5, 5, 5, 1, 10]; Output = [10, 5, 1, 2, 3, 21];  

**How to:** Implement the interface `ITopIKFrequentElements`.
